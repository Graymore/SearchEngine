# What's that

### About

SearchEngine is a special package created for laravel and php 8. It uses Manticoresearch as a base and Sphinx as an alternative. Therefore you need to locally install software from these developers to work with this package. For example all tests were run with Manticore.

### What is the need?
Generally Manticore and Sphinx do not provide the best use of APIs for different frameworks. This package provides the best syntax and adds many useful features.
